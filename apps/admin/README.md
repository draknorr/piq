# Admin Dashboard

Next.js 15 dashboard for PublisherIQ.

## Overview

The dashboard provides:

- game and company analytics
- the `/changes` Change Feed
- Insights and personalization surfaces
- admin system-status pages, catalog control, and CCU quality
- OTP-first authentication and invite/waitlist flows
- TigerData-backed chat, similarity, momentum, YouTube coverage, and change-intel contract routing through `apps/query-api`

## Development

```bash
pnpm --filter @publisheriq/admin dev
pnpm --filter @publisheriq/admin build
pnpm --filter @publisheriq/admin start
pnpm --filter @publisheriq/admin lint
```

The development server runs on `http://localhost:3001`.

Browser smoke tests run from the repo root:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm test:e2e:headed
```

The Playwright smoke suite targets `/chat` on the local admin dev server and mocks
`/api/chat/stream`, `/api/search`, and `/api/autocomplete/tags` so it stays deterministic.

The shipped `/chat` surface also supports YouTube coverage turns when
`CHAT_TIGER_YOUTUBE_ENABLED` is enabled. Those requests are proxied through
`/api/chat/youtube-coverage` and render `youtube_game_activity` responses in the
structured chat UI.

For the main full prompt-quality pass against the local TigerData-backed stack, run:

```bash
pnpm chat-evals:full-blended-endpoint
```

That endpoint runner hits the same `/api/chat/stream` route the UI uses, normalizes the
assistant output into visible-like text for scoring, and writes ranked artifacts under
`/tmp/publisheriq-chat-evals/`. It expects your local admin server and local `query-api`
to already be running unless you pass `--origin` to another reachable target. The same
run also writes tool/backend audit artifacts such as `prompt-tool-traces.json`,
`tool-usage-summary.json`, `backend-usage-summary.json`, and `migration-matrix.md` so you
can see which prompts still depend on legacy Supabase or Cube answer-path reads.

Local chat routing relies on `QUERY_API_BASE_URL` and `QUERY_API_BEARER_TOKEN`. In deployed
Vercel preview/production, `QUERY_API_BASE_URL` must be set explicitly.

For a smaller UI-level smoke pass through the real `/chat` page, run:

```bash
pnpm chat-evals:full-blended-ui
```

```

## Auth and Environment

Required variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://www.publisheriq.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=...
```

Optional diagnostics:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_DEBUG=false
```

Notes:

- The login UI is OTP-first with 8-digit codes and a 10-minute expiry.
- Protected-route redirects use `?next=...`, not `?redirect=...`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is required for safe callback and redirect handling.
